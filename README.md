Overview Of the project

Project: exploratory data analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial initial step in the data analysis process. It involves investigating datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods.
1 Understand the Data
Data Types: Identify the types of data you're working with (e.g., categorical, numerical, datetime).
Data Structure: Look at the structure of the data, including the number of rows and columns.
Missing Values: Check for missing or null values and consider how to handle them (e.g., imputation, removal)
Univariate Analysis: Analyze individual variables using histograms, box plots, or bar charts.
Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between two variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, or pair plots.
Multivariate Analysis: Use techniques like heatmaps, 3D plots, or dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA) to explore relationships among multiple variables.
Transformation: Apply log, square root, or other transformations to variables to normalize distributions.
Creation: Create new features based on existing data to enhance the model's performance.
